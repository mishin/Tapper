It integrates 10+ years of QA know-how\r\nand Linux testing expertise since 2008. It also provides the\r\ntechnology behind the Perl benchmarking infrastructure\r\n[Perl::Formance](http://perlformance.net).\r\n\r\n#### Tapper provides...\r\n\r\n* extreme continuous integration through setting up complete machines\r\n  from scratch, either image-based or via kickstart/autoyast/preseed.\r\n* alternative easy ssh-based test invocation\r\n* test facilities for the Linux kernel, virtualization based on Xen\r\n  and KVM, and running in simulators (like simnow)\r\n* support for lots of other scenarios, like suspend/resume or distributed\r\n  network tests\r\n* benchmark tracking facilities\r\n* powerful, advanced query language for test result evaluation and\r\n  forensics\r\n* a powerful scheduler to maximize utilization of a machine pool with\r\n  different use-cases organized in bandwidth-driven queues\r\n\r\n#### Tapper APIs...\r\n\r\n* are easy, without requiring dependencies to talk to them\r\n* allow integration of your existing infrastructure with nothing more\r\n  like shell scripts using \"echo\" and \"netcat\"\r\n\r\n#### Tapper encourages...\r\n\r\nthe use of language diversity for writing tests by building upon TAP,\r\nthe mature \"Test Anything Protocol\", supported in about 20 programming\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\n#### Tapper co-operates...\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n* autotest\r\n* Codespeed\r\n* TaskJuggler\r\n* any TAP emitters\r\n\r\n#### Related material\r\n\r\n* [Overview](http://tapper-testing.org/docs/linuxcon_eu_2011_linux_and_virtualization_testing_with_tapper.pdf)\r\n  presentation at Linuxcon Europe 2011\r\n* [TAP Juggling](http://tapper-testing.org/docs/yapc_eu_2011_tapjuggling.pdf)\r\n  at YAPC::EU 2011\r\n* [Query API](http://tapper-testing.org/docs/yapc_eu_2009_cinderella_tap.pdf)\r\n  at YAPC::EU 2009\r\n* Tapper on [github](http://github.com/amd) with [wiki](https://github.com/amd/Tapper/wiki)\r\n","google":""}
